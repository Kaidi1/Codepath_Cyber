  - [X] Steps to recreate:
    - First I opened the wpdistillery.vm website through the web browser. 
    - Then I posted a comment in the comment box with a comment in the format 
    - "\<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'>\</a>". 
    - This then was posted as a comment to the web page. 
    - The admin will get a notification about the comment. 
    - Once the admin clicks view page or view comment, the script will be run. 
    - This script can be used to do alot of malicious stuff.
